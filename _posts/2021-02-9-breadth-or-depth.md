I recently finished reading [Range](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41795733-range) (on the power of generalist on a world of specialists) and [One person multiple careers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/685490.One_Person_Multiple_Careers) (on people who pursue several careers simultaneously); and it has stirred something in me. It helped me put to words some concepts in my career that I couldn't define before. This will be the subject of today's post. And we will finish connecting it with another important aspect of my life: my personal relationships (touching another book I recently finished, [More than two](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21955937-more-than-two)). 

Strap in, and welcome to my head.

# Breadth, the big picture, and fuzziness

I thrive when my fingers are touching a thousand different subjects. 

That is a fact. You know it if you work with me, as I am involved on a trillion different projects and initiaties. Or if you have a conversation with me, where I jump back and forth subjects _on what appears to be random connections_. It is not something that I'm proud of, and I am aware of how it impacts my life (it makes me a more difficult-to-follow orator). But this is, clearly, something tied to my identity. And that, of course, slips into my work persona.

Because of how spread my efforts are I feel more comfortable in small teams and startup-like environment. There I can easily balance those priorities and kickstart several initiatives which all provide value. But something always felt wrong with this approach, especially on my career path. Being exhaustive and paying attention to the details is an intrinsic part of pursuing quality; so my fuzziness felt as something I had to fight with to become a better professional.

So I wonder: can I be fuzzy, generalist, and all over the place while still doing a good job? Well, it depends on what we define as a _good job_. I probably wouldn't be the best specialist on Automation, or the most comprehensive tester nor the most detailed planner. But I can definitively have a big impact on many teams. This is what I am finally coming to terms with: I have always excelled at being a **glue player**. I just didn't understand the glue player's value till now.

# Fitting on a team, building a group. The glue player.

I define a glue player as the individual who can assess the situation (or the team, or the social group), identify the role or activities that are missing or could improve, and become that to the best of their abilities; not being afraid of reassessing and adapting themselves regularly. 

I started playing with this concept after reading [Essentialism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18077875-essentialism) (on the importance of focusing the biggest impact you can make). On my group of friends, I have never been shy of driving the conversation when I see none else does it, becoming the butt of the joke when I see we need to diffuse the situation or turning into the devil's advocate. It is something I have been unconsciously doing in my personal life since... well, forever. And I see how extremely the impact it has had on my friends. But this can also make me a better team player. 

**Agile** has become one of the Guidestones of the industry, and I can't conceive how a group can be adaptable without some of its members adapting into what is needed. Till now, I had an internal fight between fulfilling the responsibilities of my role and working on what I see is most needed as a team. It wasn't easy. Many times I felt like a fraud, as it was difficult to be exhaustive while working on fixing seemly unrelated processes that were hindering us. 

Recently, thanks to building a team and being blessed by amazing and proactive colleagues, I have been able to delegate enough to rely on my team's strengths while focusing on the bigger picture. And having a bigger impact. I was lucky enough to have a say on the people who joined the team, so I could identify who would be an excellent specialist that could focus on their strengths while having enough generalists to swap between tasks and proactively raise issues that we should address. 

Which puts me in a pickle. I always struggled with the concept of middle management, but now I am starting to see its value (when it is executed in an impactful way). So one of my friends asked me a very important question. "So, what does Gino want to become next, then?" Do I want to be a manager? Do I want to become more technicaltechnical? Do I want to keep testing? I honestly don't know. I enjoy all these challenges, and I feel I excel when I can have an impact on several of them at the same time. My strength is not becoming any of those labels, but on connecting them and enabling me to become more adaptable. 

There is still plenty to work on, tho. I'm taking most of these decisions unilaterally, which of course it is neither scalable nor gets my stakeholderson board with them. I should work on better communicating these decisions and adding transparency to them. I also struggle with bringing things to conclusion, as it is very easy to focus on the next big impactful thing. I'm lucky that I can count on some of my colleagues to aid me on this, tho. 

# Without direction. Not having a passion

This also ties with another work-in-progress aspect of my life.

I have always struggled with a lack of direction. At home, I can see how my family is _throughly_ engaged with their socially-impactful careers. Some of my friends have thriving hobbies that bring them joy and growth. And some colleagues are deeply passionate about their crafts.

I... well, I am good at things. I enjoy things, to some degree. I like learning and discovering random trivia (probably to an unhealthy level, as I don't think _consuming_ 200+ books in the last 3 years is a healthy way of coping with things...). I change hobbies and like meeting people. 

Coming to terms that I can be a fuzzy mixture of concepts and labels is something that, honestly, helps me. _Maybe_ it is ok to not be passionate about something specific and become a never-ending wonderer. Or _maybe_, at some point, I would decide I want to explore a specific area in detail. But, for sure, realizing that becoming an undefined blob of many things is an option helps me. 

_Maybe_ I don't have to be many different _mes_. _Maybe_ I _am_ those differences. _Maybe_ that is what defines me, the space in between, the connection of them all.

# My other half

Of course, this touches something else that I have been exploring and pondering about in my life: Polyamory and the concept of marrying security, seduction, fun, and growth on the same partner.

On these work-related books, they touch on the importance of learning from different fields and how those lessons bring value on each other, regardless of how connected we think those fields are. How this is not a zero-sum game, spending time and effort on different aspects will improve them all, and bring more joy.

Wouldn't it be the same with affection and love? I am a better listener, partner, and lover thanks to everything I have learned from my experiences. But all those books talk about the power these experiences not needing to be in sequence, but having them simultaneously.

This is something that, _maybe_, I will explore on future posts/mind-dumps; as I am not sure if this is the path I want to follow in my life. Something that I am sure about is that I truly believe this is a valid way of living, and a concept I can wholeheartedly stand behind. 

But, as I recently told a friend, _" I'm not sure if this will be my life path; but for sure it's something I understand and could respect from my partners. I am opening my mind and heart to it, and then deciding if I want to follow it or not. Which, for me, it is an important part: "
